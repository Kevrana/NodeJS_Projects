#NodeChatApp
Very basic nodeJS + socket.io chat app with basic html and css to have real-time chat functionality. Each new tab creates a new socket id (aka user). Shows when a user connects or disconnects the chat

##How to use:
1)npm start (this will run the server.js)
2)Open tab at http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html?
3)Will prompt you for a name, on entering, you will connect to the chat
4)Each new tab will serve as a "new user" and they will show as "Connected/disconnected" when they join or leave the chat.
5)Enjoy your real-time chatroom.
